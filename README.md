# coordinates_on_a_grid

This is the first larger project that I ever worked on for myself :) I had a lot of fun with it :) Looking at it now. First of all it's incredibly suboptimal with too much integer arithmetic. And there are much better ways to do this. But still. It runs for a few minustes, and it generates several hundred random initial structures. The structures are good for searvhing the potential energy surface of small molecules. When used as initial strutures for geometry optimization, the global minimum is always identified (or at least what seemed to be the lowest energy known minimum for the structures that I was working with).
